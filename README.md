Sorting Algorithms in C++

Description

This repository provides a comprehensive collection of sorting algorithms implemented in C++. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding various sorting techniques, their complexities, and their applications in computer science. The project includes a variety of sorting algorithms, ranging from simple to advanced, allowing users to explore different approaches to sorting data.

Features

Comparison-Based Sorting Algorithms**:
  Bubble Sort:  A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  Selection Sort:  An in-place comparison algorithm that divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region, repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and moving it to the sorted region.
  Insertion Sort:  Builds a sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly taking the next element from the unsorted portion and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted portion.
  Merge Sort:  A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves back together.
  Quick Sort:  Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot, recursively sorting the partitions.

Non-Comparison-Based Sorting Algorithms:
  Counting Sort:  An integer sorting algorithm that counts the occurrences of each unique element and uses this information to place elements in their correct position.
  Radix Sort:  A non-comparison-based algorithm that sorts numbers by processing individual digits, typically using counting sort as a subroutine.
  Bucket Sort:  Distributes elements into a number of buckets, sorts each bucket individually (often using another sorting algorithm), and then concatenates the results.

Usage

To use the sorting algorithms, clone the repository and compile the provided C++ files. Each algorithm is implemented in a modular fashion, allowing users to easily integrate them into their own projects. The repository includes example code demonstrating how to use each sorting algorithm, along with performance comparisons.
